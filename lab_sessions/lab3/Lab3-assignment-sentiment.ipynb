    "1. Our expectations are in line with many of the features in the list of important words for each sentiment class. An example of this is in the negative class. Words such as “terrible”, “n’t” and “fuck” are sensible because they show strong negative emotions or complaints. They are common in tweets that express dissatisfaction. In the positive class, words like “wishes”, “!” and “top” stood out. These words are most often used when someone wants to convey excitement, compliments or celebrations. In the case of neutral tweets, we expected to see words that are more factually or emotionally neutral like “think”, “watch” and “donald”. With the new dataset, we now saw more airline-specific terms appearing. For example, \"delayed\", \"cancelled\" and \"customer\" in negative tweets, and \"thanks\", \"great\" and \"awesome\" in positive tweets. This better reflects the sentiment being analyzed within the airline context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We were surprised by some features in the list, as they were less clearly linked to sentiment. For example, we didn’t expect to see the high frequency of punctuation like colons, quotation marks and commas. This is because symbols don’t express any sentiment. We were also surprised by the fact that usernames, links and generic names such as “j” were present. These words are more topic related and don’t particularly have a positive or negative tone. Words like “china” and “language”, which appeared in the negative class were also unexpected. The tone is probably highly influenced by the context they were used in. Similarly, in the new dataset, airline names and customer service phrases were often frequent across multiple classes, which can make interpretation slightly more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If we were to improve the model, we would want to remove some of the louder and unnecessary features. For example quotation marks, links, user handles and common names, as they are often related to the topic rather than the sentiment. On the other hand, we would definitely keep words that are emotionally charged. Words such as “terrible” and “fuck”. This is because they carry strong sentimental signals. For expressing strong emotions, words like “n’t” can be useful. Through keeping these kinds of emotionally relevant words, the model will be able to better separate positive, negative and neutral tweets. Additionally, filtering out airline names may help the model rely more on emotional and contextual words rather than brand mentions."
