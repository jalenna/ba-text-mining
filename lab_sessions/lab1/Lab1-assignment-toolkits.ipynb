    "* We chose to select this sentence from the text “The six phones and tablets affected are the Galaxy S III, running the new Jelly Bean system, the Galaxy Tab 8.9 Wifi tablet, the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Galaxy Rugby Pro and Galaxy S III mini.” because it has multiple product names and numbers, which makes it a good choice to compare the two libraries.\n",
    "* The only observed differences were in the way spaCy and NLTK handle compound product names. SpaCy handled them more consistently, it tagged parts such as “S”, “mini’ and “Pro” as NNP. That means that they are part of the proper nouns. On the other hand, NLTK sometimes mislabeled them as NN, which is a common noun.\n"

    "* The difference between constituency and dependency parsing is that constituency divides the sentence into categories that are syntactically categorised. On the other hand, dependency shifts its focus on how words are related grammatically, which forms a directed graph.\n",
    "* For parsing we selected the sentence “Samsung lost a US patent case to Apple and was ordered to pay its rival $1.05bn (£0.66bn) in damages for copying features of the iPad and iPhone in its Galaxy range of devices.”. Through comparing the two libraries, it was clear that spaCy was far superior. It gave clearer grammatical relationships and it did a much better job at connecting verbs to their subjects/objects. Though NLTK was useful for hierarchical breakdowns.\n"
